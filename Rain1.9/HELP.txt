Dear user,

If you are having trouble getting past the game in story mode, try to play the game in free play.

The full educational story line is availible in the Game Play Videos version. 

The game is purposely made to be challenging. However, our team also hopes that this game can be able to provide you with a unique learning opportunity.

Once you have completed the game, check out the Rain Action Guide to learn about what you can do to help. 

Best regards,
